# Tractivity

### Project Overview

This is my final year project. I have developed an Android Application that aims to improve users' productivity.

The app helps users to track the time spent on different activities, 
tasks, or ongoing projects by allowing them to log the time spent on those activities and store it 
on the database, and then presenting the progresses to the users in chart format.

The full project is reported in the "ProjectReport.pdf" file.
